# Project Progress Report: Keeple - Time Off (1st wave of countries)

## Project Progress

**Latest Updates:**
- **07.05.2024:** Integrations ready by June 2nd.
- **07.05.2024:** Testing in progress until the end of May. Key points:
  - Sabine (consultant) returns from vacation on May 13th.
  - HR and Integration test scenarios in DevOps by May 9th.
  - Two areas where the system does not fully meet business needs identified:
    1. Not possible to request vacation in hours, only days and 1/2 days possible. Manual workaround by admin is the solution.
    2. Manual process for termination. Admin needs to calculate remaining vacation days in several steps.
- **30.04.2024:** Status meetings on Thursdays established. Integration work to start in the second half of May.
- **23.04.2024:** Testing in progress until the end of May. All 5 subsidiaries at once.
- **18.04.2024:** Admin training on April 18th, start of testing. Weekly status meetings on Thursday mornings set.

## Possible Risks

1. **Integration Delays:** Integration work is scheduled for the second half of May, which may delay the project if issues arise.
2. **System Limitations:** Identified limitations in the system (vacation requests in hours and manual termination process) may impact user satisfaction and efficiency.
3. **Consultant Availability:** Sabine's vacation until May 13th may delay progress if her input is critical.
